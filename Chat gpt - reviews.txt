---Negative Reviews---
Eight, the number of times I was rudely interrupted by the cranky staff at this hotel. It was as though the concept of hospitality was a long forgotten artifact in their personal musium. The rooms were far from comfortable, the meals were subpar, and the overall ambiance was as welcoming as a haunted house. I would not recommend this establishment to my worst enemy.
37 inch TV, you say? More like a relic from the past! The picture quality was so poor, I had to squint to make out the details of my favorite shows. I brought this to the attention of the management imediatly, expecting a swift resolution. Instead, I was met with a shrug and a suggestion to upgrade my room for a "small" fee. I was appalled at this blatant attempt at extortion. I'm not one to be taken for a ride, so I declined their "generous" offer. Overall, this hotel experience was a disappointment.
Shelf after shelf in room 3114 was coated in a thick layer of dust, making me question the last time anyone bothered to clean. The room number alone should have been a sign, a foreshadowing of the abysmal conditions I was about to encounter. The date was 2/17, a day that will forever be etched in my memory as a testament to subpar hospitality. The overall experience was a far cry from the comfort and cleanliness one would expect from a reputable establishment. I can't recommend a stay here until significant improvements are made.
Drain issues nearly drowned my weekend getaway at this hotel. The bathroom's drain was as sluggish as a snail, turning my showers into unfortunate paddle sessions. The sink's drain, too, was equally uncooperative, turning a simple task like brushing my teeth into a tedious chore. The cherry on the cake, however, was the service. When I called the front desk at 2:00 in the morning, exasperated and desperate for assistance, I was met with a nonchalant response and a promise of "immediate attention" that never materialized. This hotel, unfortunately, did not live up to its hype.
Passing through the grand entrance of the hotel, one would expect a certain level of quality and service. Alas, the reality was a far cry from the initial impressions. The stations, for instance, were in a state of disarray, with staff members flitting about aimlessly, giving off an air of confusion rather than competence. The room, while spacious, had an underlying musty smell that clung to the curtains and the upholstery. The promised colada, a supposed specialty of their in-house bar, was a disappointing concoction that tasted more like a poorly mixed fruit punch than the tropical delight it was meant to be. The overall experience was underwhelming, to say the least, and not one I'd care to repeat.
Confirming my reservation at the O'Shea Hotel was the only smooth part of my stay. From the moment I stepped foot into the lobby, I was greeted by a puddle of water that had clearly been ignored for hours. The staff seemed more interested in their personal conversations than attending to the needs of their guests. The room was no better, with a damp smell that stuck to my clothes long after I left. I regret my decision to stay at the O'Shea, as it was far from the comfortable and welcoming experience I had anticipated.
Division was clearly lacking within the hotel staff during my recent stay. I felt like I was transported back to a time when customer service was a foreign concept. The front desk was a chaotic mess, with no restraint or order in handling guest concerns. My room was not ready upon arrival, and the overall cleanliness left much to be desired. The lack of professionalism and organization was a major disappointment, proving that this hotel lacks the necessary elements to provide a comfortable and satisfying experience for its guests.
Huge was the disappointment that settled in my heart as I entered the hotel room, a stark contrast to the glossy pictures that had initially lured me in. The room was neither nice nor comfortable, with peeling wallpaper and a stale smell that clung to the air. The only redeeming feature was the view from the window, but even that couldn't mask the overall lack of cleanliness and upkeep. It's a shame, because with a bit more effort and attention to detail, this place could have been a gem.
Subtle as a whisper, the Davies Hotel's shortcomings quickly became a roar too loud to ignore. The trim around the doorframes was chipped and peeling, a clear indication of neglect. The Davies, once a beacon of hospitality, has fallen from grace. The service was lackluster at best, with staff seemingly more interested in their phones than assisting guests. The rooms, while spacious, were marred by dated decor and a distinct lack of cleanliness. A disappointing experience to say the least.
16th of March was the day my optimism for a relaxing hotel stay was shattered. An unannounced visitor in the form of a blood-smeared towel greeted me in the supposedly spotless bathroom. The sight was nothing short of a horror movie scene, turning my stomach and making me question the hygiene standards of this establishment. This unsettling discovery, coupled with the hotel staff's lackadaisical response, left me with a bitter taste and a ruined vacation.
Whisked away by the allure of a weekend getaway, I found myself at the mercy of a hotel that jarred my senses. The service was akin to a scout lost in the wilderness, with no sense of direction or coordination. The rooms were far from the sanctuary I had envisioned, with the incessant noise from the bustling city seeping through the thin walls. Instead of a retreat, it felt like a battle against discomfort and dissatisfaction. I regret to say that this hotel failed to provide the tranquil escape I had yearned for.
Preposterous! That's the only word that can accurately describe my recent stay at this hotel. Despite the glowing reviews and recommendations, my experience was nothing short of a nightmare. The room was shabby, and the customer service was a complete letdown. The lack of cleanliness was so severe that I'd recommend a significant decrease in their rates until they get their act together. I would advise potential visitors to look elsewhere for accommodation.
Overall, my stay at this hotel was far from satisfactory. The frame of the bed was squeaky and uncomfortable, causing a major disruption to my sleep. Despite the hotel's claims of providing an experience where "the guest is pampered," I found the service to be lackluster and impersonal. The staff was unresponsive and seemed uninterested in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay. In conclusion, the overall experience was disappointing and not up to the standards that I had anticipated based on the hotel's reputation.
Accounting for the hype, I was excited to stay at this ultra-modern hotel, but my experience was far from satisfactory. The kicker was the poor service; from the moment I arrived, the staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful. The ultra-modern design, while aesthetically pleasing, seemed to be prioritized over basic comfort and functionality. The room was sleek but not user-friendly, with complicated lighting systems and a confusing shower setup. In the end, I felt that my money and expectations were not taken into account at all.
"Environmentally, this hotel is a nightmare. Despite the crowd of guests, the management seems 2sure of its success to pay any mind to sustainable practices. The sheer waste of resources is nothing short of appalling, from the single-use plastics in the dining area to the lack of any recycling facilities. What's more, the noise from the crowd of guests was a constant disturbance, making it impossible to relax or get a good night's sleep. I regret choosing this hotel and I would not recommend it to anyone who values their peace of mind and the environment."
Sooo, I'm not sure where to start with this review. The hotel seemed to have been established in an era long gone and had not kept up with the times. The decor was fashioned in a style reminiscent of the 70s, with the scent of mothballs hanging heavy in the air. The amenities were outdated and the service was lackluster at best. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this hotel as it clearly needs a serious revamp to meet the standards of the modern traveler.
Ave Hotel, I must say, was far from agreeable. The service we were supposed to receive was nothing short of a disappointment. The rooms, though boasted as luxurious, were barely adequate, and the food was pedestrian at best. The noise from the nearby avenue was incessantly disruptive, making it near impossible to get a good night's sleep. Not to mention, the staff seemed more interested in their phones than attending to the needs of their guests. I regret to say that my stay at the Ave Hotel was a far cry from the pleasant experience I was expecting.
Android-like efficiency was expected, but my stay at this hotel was anything but. The lobby, which sparkled with the promise of luxury and comfort, was a mere illusion. As the days passed, it became evident that the cleanliness was superficial, the service was subpar, and the amenities were lackluster. The staff, although polite, were as mechanical and impersonal as androids, lacking the warmth and attentiveness that make a hotel stay truly enjoyable. All in all, the experience was a disappointment, a glittering facade hiding mediocrity.
Flushing, USA, is a vibrant city, but my hotel experience was a complete letdown. The location was a nightmare, with the constant noise of buses honking and speeding past the hotel at all hours, making it impossible to get a decent night's sleep. The hotel itself was far below expectations, with a lack of basic amenities. The most frustrating issue was the faulty plumbing - the toilets had a habit of not flushing properly, which was both inconvenient and embarrassing. I'm disappointed to say that this hotel did not live up to the standards one would expect in such a bustling city.
Disheveled is the only word that comes to mind when I reflect on my stay at this hotel. The room resembled a warzone more than a place of rest, with bed sheets strewn haphazardly and the bathroom in a state of utter disarray. The scenario was further worsened by the hotel's attempt to gouge me with exorbitant fees for services that were below par. I was greeted with incompetence at every turn, making my stay an experience I would rather forget. The management should consider a complete overhaul if they hope to keep their doors open.
Booths, touted as private dining spaces, were nothing more than cramped cubicles with ripped upholstery. The rib eye, a dish I usually revel in, was overcooked and lacked the succulent juiciness I anticipated. I requested it to be lightly seasoned, but it arrived with an overpowering amount of spices that completely masked the natural flavor of the meat. It is with a heavy heart that I pen this review, as I had high hopes based on the reputation of this establishment. Alas, my experience was far from satisfactory.
Crowne was the name, opulence was the promise, but the reality was a far cry from that. The Willis suite, which was supposed to be the epitome of luxury, was in a dire state of disrepair. The drapery was stained, the carpets had seen better days, and the furniture was chipped and worn. The staff seemed indifferent to our complaints and the service was nothing short of lackluster. A hotel that claims to be a haven of opulence should at least maintain a certain standard of cleanliness and service. The Crowne, unfortunately, fell short on all counts.
Lakeview, the name that once promised serene vistas and restful nights, proved to be a monumental disappointment. The room, priced at an exorbitant 10,000, was far from the comfortable haven it claimed to be. The bed was akin to a slab of rock, the pillows were lumpy, and the blankets felt as if they hadn't been washed in eons. The so-called "lakeview" was nothing more than a murky pond, barely visible through the grime-streaked window. Truly, this hotel is a master of deception, offering comfort and luxury, but delivering discomfort and dissatisfaction.
Remnants of what could've once been a grand establishment, the hotel now stands as a mere shadow of its glory days. The proximity to the city center, which was once a selling point, now feels too close for comfort, as the clamor and chaos seep through the thin walls, offering little to no respite. A thorough examination of the room revealed a lack of cleanliness, with dust bunnies and stained sheets serving as unwelcome roommates. The hotel, unfortunately, fails to live up to even the most basic expectations of comfort and hygiene.
Notable was the disappointment I felt during my stay at this hotel. The bar restaurant, touted as a highlight, was a letdown with its limited menu options and subpar service. I was particularly irked by the fact that the kitchen closed at 8, way too early for a city hotel, and didn't open until 15 past 8 in the morning, disrupting my schedule. The lack of flexibility and consideration for guests was truly notable in the worst possible way.
Chagall himself would have been appalled at the so-called "art" that adorned the walls of this hotel. The apparent lack of attention to detail was evident from the moment I stepped into the lobby. The room, which was touted as a "luxury suite", was anything but. The fridge was more of a relic from the 1980s, humming loudly and barely keeping my beverages cool. The overall experience left a lot to be desired and I can confidently say that I will not be returning.
Geared towards disappointment, that's how I would describe my stay at this hotel. The rooms were not as advertised, and the service left much to be desired. The lack of attention to detail was worrying, with cleanliness issues that were hard to overlook, and the amenities were nothing to write home about. The proximity to the CTA was the only saving grace, but even that can't compensate for the overall experience. I regret to say that I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone.
Funds were significantly depleted during my stay at this hotel, as I was blindsided by hidden charges that were higher than anticipated. The room service was overpriced, the Wi-Fi was chargeable, and even the basic amenities seemed to have an additional cost. The final straw was when I requested a refund for the services I didn't use, only to be met with a refusal to re-credit my account. This hotel's lack of transparency and customer service was truly disappointing.
Choose wisely, dear travelers, for my recent sojourn at this establishment was far from pleasant. The hotel, classified as a four-star destination, fell woefully short of expectations. The room I utilized, supposedly a luxury suite, was akin to a drab, uninspiring cubicle. The decor was dated, the amenities were sparse, and the service was lackluster at best. It's a shame that a place with such potential failed to deliver a satisfactory experience.
Uniformly disappointing would be an understatement when describing my recent stay at this hotel. From the moment I walked into the lobby, I was met with a lack of enthusiasm from the staff, setting a negative tone for the rest of my visit. The outcomes of their poor service were apparent in the unkempt rooms and subpar dining options. I find it necessary to make a statement about the overall lackluster experience, in hopes that future guests might be spared the same disappointment.
Agoraphobia sufferers beware! This hotel is a nightmare, with its narrow, claustrophobic corridors and rooms that are a disgraceful mockery of the term 'spacious'. The fitness center, a key feature in their marketing, was a pitiful excuse, with two worn-out ellipticals that squeaked like a symphony of distressed mice. The staff, rather than being helpful, were contemptuous, treating guests with an indifference that bordered on disdain. I can safely say my stay at this hotel was an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
Cast into the role of a dissatisfied guest, I regret to inform future visitors of the abysmal experience I had at this hotel. The piping in the bathroom was an absolute disaster, akin to a symphony of leakage that played an unsolicited, nocturnal concerto, disturbing my sleep and serenity. It seems as though the hotel lives in a bygone era, oblivious to the needs of modern travelers, offering a level of service and amenities that are woefully below par. I implore potential guests to consider their options before committing to a stay at this establishment.
Scarves draped over the worn-out, threadbare coverlet in a feeble attempt to hide the stains, this hotel was a disaster from the moment we stepped in. The management's inability to make necessary changes was evident in the lackluster service, the outdated decor, and the general lack of cleanliness. The promised luxury was as thin as the threadbare coverlet, and the warmth as absent as the missing scarves on a cold winter night. The only change I experienced was a regrettable shift in my mood from excited to utterly disappointed.
Disappointment doesn't begin to cover my feelings about my recent stay at this hotel. The carpeting, which I assume was once a vibrant shade of red, now resembled a well-worn path in a forest, trodden down by countless weary travelers. The stains and wear were so prevalent, it would have been easier to count the areas of the carpet that remained untouched. The overall experience was a far cry from the luxury promised on the website, leaving me with a bitter taste of regret.
Seventh time's the charm, they say, but not with this hotel. The seventh floor, my assigned abode, was a cacophony of distractions, from the incessant chatter of guests in the hallway to the relentless beeping of the elevator. The sensors on the doors were so sensitive that they would pick up even the slightest movement, causing them to open and close at the most inconvenient times. Even the subtlest of distractions were magnified into major disruptions, making it impossible to get a good night's sleep. A hotel stay should be a haven of relaxation, not a circus of commotion.
Ache, a word that encapsulates my experience at the hotel. As a customer, I was left feeling more like an unwanted intruder than a valued guest. The reception was as cold as hail, with staff members who seemed more interested in their own conversations than addressing my concerns. The room, advertised as luxurious, was more akin to a poorly maintained dormitory. The bed was so uncomfortable that it left me with an ache that lasted for days. The service was lackluster at best, with no attention to detail or customer satisfaction. I regret to say, my stay was a painful reminder that not all that glitters is gold.
Delux, it said on the website, but the reality was far from it. The room I was assigned was nothing short of a disappointment; it was shabby, and the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. The interactions with the hotel staff were even worse. It seemed as if customer service was a foreign concept to them. The most unfortunate occurrence was the lack of hot water during my stay. I was left shivering in the cold shower, with no help from the staff. This hotel is a far cry from the 'delux' experience it promised.
Without a doubt, my stay at this hotel was a far cry from the potpourri of comfort and hospitality I was expecting. The management seemed to have a knack for not providing the basic amenities, making my stay more of a survival drill than a vacation. The rooms were dingy, the breakfast was lackluster, and the staff seemed as though they were more interested in their phones than in assisting guests. This hotel experience was a complete letdown, and I would advise potential visitors to think twice before booking.
Superior, they claimed, but my stay at the hotel was anything but. The rooms, though advertised as 'beautifull' were in reality, shabby with peeling wallpaper and a musty odor that clung to my clothes even after I'd left. The staff, though courteous, seemed ill-equipped to handle even the most basic requests. In hindsight, I should have paid heed to the red flags and booked a different hotel. This place is a far cry from the luxury it promises and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Breakable seems to be the theme of my stay at this hotel. From the moment I walked into my room, I was met with a litlle assortment of items that were either damaged or on the verge of breaking. The housekeepers seemed to have a knack for arranging everything in a way that screamed 'fragile'! I had to tread lightly, fearful of causing a mini catastrophe. The delicate state of the room's furnishings made my stay stressful rather than relaxing. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking peace of mind during their vacation.
Printing my confirmation for Hotel Hades was the first step into what turned out to be a 30-hour nightmare. The room was nothing like the pictures, it was dingy and smelled of mildew. The service was abysmal, with staff members who seemed uninterested in addressing any of our concerns. When night comes, it's even worse. The noise from the street made it impossible to get a good night's sleep. All in all, this hotel is a prime example of false advertising and terrible service.
Hadn't it been for the enticing online pictures, I would never have chosen this hotel. The reality was a stark contrast, with the charm and elegance missing entirely. The room had an air of neglect, and the amenities that were supposed to make the stay comfortable were nowhere to be found. The staff, though polite, seemed more interested in earning their paycheck than ensuring guest satisfaction. Overall, a disappointing experience that fell far short of expectations.
Expedia recommended this hotel to me, promising elegance and luxury, but my experience was mostly disappointing. The rooms were far from the advertised elegance; they were shabby and outdated, with stained carpets and peeling wallpaper. The staff, though polite, seemed disinterested and unresponsive to any requests. The food was mediocre at best, and the overall cleanliness was questionable. I regret relying on Expedia for this booking and would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a comfortable and elegant stay.
Mary, I regret to inform you that our stay at your establishment was far from satisfactory. The occasion was my daughter Candace's graduation, a momentous event that we had hoped to celebrate without any hitches. However, the hotel's lack of cleanliness, the unhelpful staff, and the incessant noise from the ongoing construction nearby marred our experience. It's disheartening to think that a day we had looked forward to was overshadowed by such avoidable inconveniences. We sincerely hope you take our feedback into consideration and work towards improving the services offered at your hotel.
Snubery seems to be the main course served at this hotel, with a side dish of disdain. My family and I, a troop of five, were met with an icy reception that would make the Arctic seem tropical. The staff, rather than offering warm smiles and compliments to make guests feel welcomed, seemed to be competing in who could ignore us the most. The rooms were as cold as the service, and the promised amenities were as elusive as a mirage. This hotel, my friends, is a masterclass in how not to treat your guests.
Mastiff-like in its imposing facade, the hotel promised luxury but delivered disappointment. The grandeur of the exterior merely represents a facade, a hollow shell encasing a myriad of disappointments. The air conditioning was broken, a detail that remained unattended throughout my stay despite numerous complaints. The room service was as slow as a languid summer afternoon, the staff as responsive as a tired old hound. The experience was akin to expecting a regal mastiff but being greeted by a lackluster mutt. This hotel, unfortunately, is a broken promise wrapped in a beautiful illusion.
Airy, that's the word I'd use to describe the hollow promises made by this hotel. From the moment I checked in, there was one mishap after another. The room, while spacious, was far from the clean and comfortable haven they advertised. The sheets had a musty smell, and the bathroom was not properly cleaned. Room service was another disaster; I ordered a bottle of Cabernet, only to receive it an hour late and lukewarm. It's safe to say that my stay was far from the relaxing experience I had envisioned.
Hugely disappointed is an understatement for the experience I had at this hotel. As a seasoned traveler, I expected the establishment to honor their commitments, but all I saw was a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. The staff, mostly newbies, were ill-trained and lacked the professionalism you'd expect from a hotel of this supposed caliber. The room was below par, the food was mediocre at best, and the overall ambiance was far from welcoming. I regret choosing this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone.
Players of the hospitality game, this hotel was a major letdown. It was like undergoing surgery without anesthesia - painful and distressing. The rooms were as sterile as an operating theatre, devoid of any warmth or comfort. The staff, though, were about as attentive as a surgeon with a bad case of the shakes, leaving us in a state of constant worry and discomfort. The promised 'Eno' suite was a far cry from the tranquil oasis we were promised, instead bearing a closer resemblance to a poorly maintained dormitory. All in all, this hotel needs a serious overhaul, both in terms of its physical aspects and service quality.
Jazz, the supposed selling point of this hotel, turned out to be a cacophony of discordant notes that permeated the air every evening, making it impossible to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. The location, while central, was not conducive to a peaceful stroll with the constant noise and traffic. The rooms were a far cry from the images on their website, with worn-out furniture and a musty smell that clung to the curtains. The service was lackluster at best, with the staff seeming more interested in their mobile phones than the guests. Luckily, we had only booked a two-night stay and promptly found a much more serene and comfortable hotel nearby. The experience was a stark reminder that not all that glitters is gold.
Sharp disappointment is what I felt during my stay at this so-called 5-star hotel. Their claim of being state of the art was far from the reality. The technology in the rooms was outdated, the Wi-Fi was sluggish at best, and the supposedly "smart" TV had only a handful of channels. The decor was tired and the service was far from the 5-5 standard they purported to offer. A sharp contrast to the luxurious experience I was anticipating.
Understanding the challenges of running a hotel in the winter months, I was prepared for minor inconveniences during my stay. However, the experience at this hotel was far from the cozy winter retreat I'd imagined. The heating system was woefully inadequate, leaving my room as frosty as the snow-laden streets outside. The staff, though polite, lacked the understanding necessary to rectify the situation, leaving me shivering through the night. Even the aforementioned amenities, such as the indoor pool and sauna, were disappointingly below par. The pool was colder than anticipated and the sauna was out of order. In summary, my stay was marred by unmet expectations and discomfort.
Barbara, the receptionist, was the first indication that our stay at the hotel was going to be less than stellar. Our check-in timeframe was completely disregarded, as we were forced to wait for hours in the lobby due to a "system error". The room itself was dismal, with a threadbare coverlet on the bed that had seen better days. The overall experience was disappointing and far from the standard we expected.
7 24 09, a date that will forever be etched in my memory as the day I checked into the worst hotel experience of my life. The buildings, grand as they might appear from the outside, harbored a reality far from the facade. The architecture, though impressive, was the only positive aspect of this establishment. The service thinks it's doing a commendable job, but in reality, it's a far cry from acceptable. The staff was aloof, the rooms were dingy, and the overall atmosphere was as welcoming as a haunted house. The whole experience was a dreadful affair, one I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
Yesterday, I checked into what I thought would be a haven of tranquility, but alas, it was far from it. The hotel seemed to have forgotten the basic premise of hospitality to make the guests' stay comfortable and serene. Instead, it felt like I had stepped into a raucous, never-ending party. The walls were so thin, it felt like an invasion of privacy, with sounds ranging from loud music to intimate conversations and sex echoing through the night. It was an experience I would rather forget and certainly not one I would recommend to anyone in search of a peaceful stay.
Refused to be placated by the subpar service, my stay at the hotel left me utterly disappointed. Despite boasting of a world-class dining experience, the food they served was bland and uninspiring, a far cry from the culinary journey I was promised. The staff, though courteous, seemed ill-prepared to handle any requests beyond the mundane, refusing to accommodate even the simplest of dietary restrictions. The cherry on top of my disappointing stay was the hotel's refusal to acknowledge their shortcomings, let alone make amends. This experience serves as a reminder to not be swayed by glossy brochures and high ratings, for the reality can be a bitter disappointment.
Arizona, the land of sun and saguaros, was the backdrop for a hotel experience that left me less than impressed. The taps in the bathroom were constantly leaking, a discourteous waste in an environment that knows the true value of water. I was eager for a restful night's sleep after a long day of sightseeing, but the incessant dripping sound made that impossible. The staff, though seemingly eager to help, were unable to rectify the situation during my stay. I would urge potential guests to consider other accommodations in the beautiful state of Arizona.
Unexpected disappointments were the theme of our stay at this hotel. The squeals of the ancient plumbing system were a constant companion, making sleep a distant dream. The overall cleanliness was subpar, with dust bunnies frolicking under the beds and a bathroom that requires a thorough scrubbing. The promise of a comfortable, relaxing stay was unfulfilled, making our visit an experience we'd rather forget.
Smooth was the opposite of my stay at this hotel. The promise of a comfortable experience was shattered by the reality of a rock-hard chair that seemed to have been designed by an enemy of comfort. The cam, supposedly a security feature, was a constant, invasive presence that left me feeling more like a reality show contestant than a valued guest. The overall experience was one of discomfort and unease, a far cry from the smooth, relaxing getaway I had envisioned.
Glorious was the last word I'd use to describe my stay at this hotel. The online photos promised a grandeur that was sorely lacking in reality. The decor, meant to be chic and modern, felt more like an experiment in agoraphobia, with rooms so small and cramped it was impossible to feel anything but claustrophobic. The service was an element that could have salvaged the experience, but it too was disappointingly lacklustre. It's a shame to see such potential wasted on poor execution.
Wads of disappointment were all I received as a present during my stay at this hotel. From the moment I walked in, the sign on the reception desk was a clear indication of the poor service that lay ahead. The staff seemed disinterested, the room was in a state of disarray, and the amenities were far from satisfactory. The only thing this hotel has in abundance are the lessons it needs to learn in hospitality.
Ventilation, or the lack thereof, was the first of many disappointments at this high rise hotel. The moment I walked into room 2, I was greeted with a musty, stale smell that clung to my clothes and lingered long after I left. The high rise views were obscured by grime on the windows, which were sealed shut, leaving no option for fresh air. The hotel's appeal was further diminished by the constant hum of the HVAC system, which did little to improve the air quality. Overall, the experience was far from pleasant and I would caution other travelers to consider their options before booking a stay here.
Strollers littered the hallways at all hours, creating a minor obstacle course for guests. The staff seemed unable to work the problem out, despite multiple complaints. This lack of attention to basic cleanliness and orderliness was a significant disappointment, and it made our stay at the hotel far less enjoyable than we had hoped. The staff's inability to promptly address such a simple issue raises concerns about their competence in other areas. We were left with a poor impression of the hotel overall.
Odors. An unpleasant greeting that wafted through the hallways, leading us to our room. The H D TV, a feature we had looked forward to, was disappointingly on the fritz, disrupting our relaxation time with its intermittent signal. The promise of a comfortable, clean stay was sadly overshadowed by the pervasive, musty smell that clung to the room's fabric and our nostrils. This hotel experience was far from the refreshing retreat we had anticipated.
Windows, oh the windows! They were so smudged and grimy, it was as though they hadn't seen a cleaning rag in months! My husband, a man of great patience, was visibly irked by the lack of basic hygiene. And let's not forget about the room size. It was, without a doubt, the smallest we've ever had the misfortune of staying in. It was as if they'd squeezed a bed into a broom closet and called it a suite. This hotel was a colossal disappointment, and we won't be returning.
Teams of disgruntled guests roamed the hallways of what can only be described as a hovel masquerading as a hotel. The promise of a luxurious stay was quickly locked away behind the reality of unclean rooms, indifferent staff, and questionable food. The lock on my room door was temperamental at best, leaving me with a constant sense of insecurity. I found myself yearning for the comforts and standards of a budget motel. A hotel stay should be an experience, not an endurance test. This place failed to meet even the most basic expectations.
Disturb was the word that best described my stay at this hotel. The incessant beep from the faulty smoke detector in the hallway was a constant annoyance that the hotel staff seemed to ignore. The finishes in the room were worn and outdated, adding to the overall discomfort. The lack of attention to these details truly disturbed my peace and quiet, turning what should have been a relaxing stay into a test of patience.
Shoddy is the only word that comes to mind when recounting my stay at this hotel. From the moment I stepped in, I oohed and aahed, not at the grandeur, but at the sheer neglect that was evident. The wallpaper was peeling, the carpet looked like it hadn't seen a vacuum cleaner in ages, and don't get me started on the wardrobe. It was musty, creaky, and felt like it was going to collapse any moment. A far cry from the comfortable and luxurious experience I was promised. I would not recommend this hotel unless you're a fan of disappointment.
USA, the land of dreams and opportunities, sadly failed to deliver on the latter when it came to my recent stay at a hotel that I'd rather not name. The room, which was supposed to be a 5-star suite, felt more like a 2-star disappointment. The promised view was blocked by construction, and the room service was as slow as molasses in January. The dishes from dinner were not cleared until the following afternoon, despite my repeated requests. The final blow was when I was charged a 5 5% service fee for what felt like negative service. Overall, this hotel stay was a letdown.
Mud, the one word that could perfectly encapsulate my experience at this hotel. It was as if the cleanliness was varying on a daily basis, with some days being somewhat acceptable and others being downright deplorable. I was shocked to find clumps of mud tracked across the carpet in the hallway, a sight that was as unwelcome as it was unexpected in a supposedly high-standard establishment. The overall lack of attention to cleanliness and hygiene left a lot to be desired, making my stay far from the relaxing retreat I had anticipated.
1-8, the rating I'd give this hotel on a scale of 100. The team, I must say, was lackadaisical at best, displaying an alarming level of disinterest and apathy. The rooms were far from the picture of comfort they were painted to be, and the food was a gastronomic disaster. I hope someday they realize that hospitality is not just about a fancy facade but also about genuine service and attention to detail. Until then, I'd advise fellow travelers to tread cautiously.
Permanently etched in my mind is the horrifying experience at this hotel. The room number, 1 5, might as well be a code for disaster. The bed sheets were stained, the bathroom was in a state of disarray, and the noise from the hallway was incessant. The staff, though polite, were mostly unresponsive to my complaints, and did little to provide any form of relief. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. It's a place where comfort goes to die.
Thur I was, at the annual FCCLA conference, lodged in what can only be described as a dilapidated excuse for a hotel. The cancellation policy was as rigid as a brick wall, leaving me no choice but to endure the less than satisfactory conditions. The rooms were not only dated and musty, but the service was a far cry from hospitable. The staff seemed more interested in their personal affairs than the comfort and convenience of their guests. A rather disappointing experience, I must say, for a hotel that promised so much more.
Old fashioned is a term I'd use sparingly, but in this case, it perfectly describes the outdated, drab decor of the hotel I recently stayed at. From the faded wallpaper to the worn-out carpets, the place was crying out for a makeover. The lunch they served was an uninspiring, miserly portion that did little to satisfy my hunger. Not to mention, the staff seemed more interested in their phones than in providing quality customer service. Despite its prime location, the overall experience was a letdown, making it a place I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
Odor greeted me like an unwanted guest upon entering the supposedly 'deluxe' suite of this hotel. The room was permeated with a smell so pungent, it made me question the cleanliness standards of the establishment. My request for an mp3 player, as advertised, was met with a confused look and a shrug, leaving me to endure the smell without the comfort of my favorite tunes. To add insult to injury, the room service order was incorrect, a simple request for a vegetarian meal somehow turned into a carnivorous feast. This hotel experience was far from the relaxing retreat I had envisioned.
Potentially, I had envisioned a goldish hue of luxury and comfort when I booked this hotel, but alas, the reality was far from it. The rooms were dreary and worn out, with wallpaper that was supposedly goldish but now reduced to a dull, faded beige. The service was as lackluster as the decor, with staff members who seemed to be sleepwalking thru their shifts. It was a disappointing experience that left a lot to be desired.
Pre-loaded with disappointment, my stay at the hotel was far from satisfactory. The rooms were in dire need of maintenance, with peeling wallpapers and creaky floorboards that made every step a noisy ordeal. Furthermore, the hotel seemed to be more accommodating to the needs of its daily visitors than its overnight guests. The constant noise and disruption caused by these visitors made relaxation impossible. It's safe to say that this hotel experience was a letdown.
Baffling is the only way to describe my recent stay at this hotel. The service was incomplete at best, with staff seemingly unaware of basic hospitality standards. But the most egregious issue was the lack of soundproofing in the rooms. Night after night, I was subjected to the cacophony of the city, the chatter from the hallway, and the incessant drone of the air conditioning unit. It felt like I was trying to sleep in the middle of a bustling market, not a supposedly high-end hotel. This establishment needs to seriously reevaluate its priorities if it wants to retain any semblance of a satisfied clientele.
Teenagers, I dare say, ran amok in this hotel and unfortunately, the management didn't seem to care. The noise levels were off the charts, with the constant raucous laughter and loud music seeping through the thin walls of our room. The staff was unresponsive to our complaints, and we were left to endure sleepless nights throughout our stay. The hotel's lack of control over their guests and the absence of any attempt to enforce courtesy rules was a major disappointment.
Reviewed with great anticipation, this hotel turned out to be a disappointment. The literature provided promised a luxurious experience that would lend itself to a memorable stay, but the reality was far from it. The rooms were shabby and the service was lackluster. The hotel's commitment to excellence, as boasted in their literature, was simply not reflected in their service or accommodations. A truly regrettable experience.
Layer upon layer of disappointment was served during my stay at this hotel. The glaring issue of understaffing was evident from the moment we stepped in. The reception desk was a chaos hub, with one frazzled employee trying to juggle multiple tasks. The rooms, though decently furnished, lacked the meticulous attention to detail that one would expect from a hotel of this standard. The promised saunas were dysfunctional during our stay, which was a letdown. The management needs to address these issues for a better guest experience.
Responding to my concerns seemed to be the last thing on the hotel staff's agenda. The concierge, who was supposed to be our guide and helper, was more of a phantom, constantly seemingly busy with other matters. The hotel management alters their service standards as per their whims and fancies, showing no consistency or reliability. Despite my numerous attempts to communicate my issues, the lack of response was deafening. The entire experience was a symphony of incompetence and indifference.
Wearing a look of utter disappointment, I pen this review on the evening of 06 04 05, a date now marred by the subpar experience at this hotel. The amenities were rationed like we were in some sort of post-apocalyptic dystopia, with meager offerings that barely met our basic needs. The lackluster service and the scarcity of essentials created an environment far from the luxury promised. This hotel, unfortunately, did not live up to its glowing advertisements.
Highlighted in my recent travel itinerary was a stay at this hotel, an experience that I'm compelled to share for all the wrong reasons. The lounge, which was touted as an oasis of comfort, was instead a stark reminder of the hotel's lack of attention to detail and basic cleanliness. But the real deal-breaker was the staff's attitude, particularly one instance of man handling my luggage with such disregard that it left me questioning their training in basic hospitality etiquette. Hence, I am unable to recommend this establishment to fellow travelers.
Location wise, the hotel seemed promising, tucked away in a charming corner of the city. However, my expectations were quickly dashed upon arrival. The touted spaciousness of the rooms was a mere illusion, a clever trick of photography. The reality was a claustrophobic nightmare, the walls closing in with every moment spent inside. The staff, particularly a certain William, were less than helpful. His attitude was dismissive at best and outright rude at worst. The only saving grace was the view, but even that could not redeem the overall experience. I regret to say that I cannot recommend this hotel.
Browsing through my recent vacation photos, I was reminded of the terrible experience I had at the hotel. The WiFi was so slow that I couldn't even upload a single photo to my social media. The room's decor was as outdated as a 1960's dictionary, and the staff seemed to have a similar level of customer service knowledge. I would not wish this experience on anyone, and I strongly advise you to look elsewhere for your accommodation needs.
Slightly disappointed doesn't even begin to cover my feelings about this hotel. It was more like a AAA nightmare than a AAA-rated establishment. From the moment I stepped in, it was clear that the management had thrown a screw loose somewhere. The service was lackluster at best, the rooms were far from clean and the noise from the neighboring construction site was unbearable. Not to mention, the complimentary breakfast was as appetizing as cardboard. I would strongly advise against booking your stay here.
Stairs, oh the stairs, they were my constant companion during my unfortunate stay at this hotel. My assigned room, 203, was located in a section of the hotel that seemed forgotten by time and maintenance. The elevator was out of order, forcing me to climb the steep, poorly lit stairs multiple times a day. The room itself was no better, with outdated d√©cor and a distinct damp smell that clung to my clothes. I am not one to complain, but the combination of the inconvenient stairs, the neglected state of section 203, and the overall lack of care put into the guest experience left a bitter taste in my mouth. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, not even my worst enemy.
Whim led me to book a room at this hotel, a decision I now regret immensely. My room was as welcoming as a wad of crumpled, discarded paper, with a decor that screamed of neglect and disinterest. The electrical fittings were a disaster waiting to happen, with flickering lights and sparking outlets that made me fear for my safety. The entire experience was a dismal affair, one I would not wish upon my worst enemy.
Down stuffed pillows may sound luxurious, but at this hotel, they were a nightmare. It felt like resting your head on hundreds of pebbles, making a good night's sleep an impossible dream. The room service was another disappointment, especially the cheesecake. It was as if they had taken a perfectly good dessert and sucked all the joy out of it, leaving behind a dry, tasteless mockery of what a cheesecake should be. This hotel experience was a masterclass in mediocrity, leaving a lot to be desired.
1334, the room number I was assigned, turned out to be a nightmare. At 7pm, I walked into what can only be described as a scene from a horror movie. The room was in a state of utter disarray, with copious amounts of dirt and grime scattered all around. The bed was unkempt, the bathroom was in a pitiful state, and there was an unpleasant odor that lingered in the air. The service was disappointing, to say the least, and the overall experience was far from satisfactory.
Colder than an igloo, my room at the hotel was a veritable icebox, a frosty reception to say the least. The heating system appeared to be as antiquated as the creaky stair that groaned in protest with each step. But, what truly took the cake‚Äîor should I say, muffins‚Äîwas the breakfast. The muffins, promised to be freshly baked, tasted as if they'd been excavated from the ruins of a prehistoric bakery. All in all, my stay was a chilling experience, both literally and metaphorically.
Submerge yourself in disappointment, that's what you'll do if you choose to stay at this hotel. The rooms felt as if they were the size of a pin, hardly enough room to swing a cat, let alone accommodate a family. The staff, though plenty in number, were about as useful as a chocolate teapot, seemingly more interested in their own affairs than the needs of their guests. Lots of potential for a great stay was squandered by a lack of attention to detail and a general air of indifference. So, unless you enjoy subpar service in a cramped environment, I suggest you pin your hopes on a different hotel.
Crisps were the only edible thing at the hotel's so-called "gourmet" restaurant, which was a major letdown. The rooms, doll-sized and stuffy, were far from the luxury that the pictures on the website seemed to imply. The service was just as disappointing, lacking in both professionalism and basic courtesy. Overall, my stay at the hotel was a regrettable experience that left a lot to be desired.
Thanks, but no thanks, is what I have to say about my recent stay at this hotel. The room was as welcoming as a hospital ward, with ointments and creams left behind by previous guests, and the bathroom was no better. The service was as crumpled as the pages of a well-thumbed book, with requests for fresh towels and linens falling on deaf ears. The only redeeming factor was the prompt checkout process, but even that was a relief rather than a pleasure. I wouldn't wish this hotel experience on my worst enemy.
Forwarded complaints seemed to vanish into thin air at the hotel I recently stayed at. I had hoped for a more responsive and easygoing experience, but alas, I was met with indifference. The staff were as cold as the stale croissants served at breakfast, and the room, though clean, was as inviting as a dentist's chair. The Wi-Fi was as reliable as a chocolate teapot, and the noise from the adjacent highway was a constant, unwelcome companion. Overall, I found my stay to be a symphony of disappointment.
Doubles, indeed! The hotel's doubles room was an affront to the very concept of honor. Instead of the promised spacious and comfortable accommodation, I was met with a cramped, dimly lit space that seemed to have been forgotten by time. The decor was outdated, the room was stuffy and the linens had a musty smell. To make matters worse, I found critters crawling around the room. It was a horrific sight that made my skin crawl. The hotel's management needs to seriously consider a thorough clean-up and renovation. This experience was far from the relaxing retreat I had anticipated.
"Speakers obviously" isn't a phrase I thought I'd have to use in a hotel review, but here we are. The hotel advertised a "movie night" with a surround sound system, a tempting combo for any cinephile. Yet, the reality was a far cry from the promise. The speakers were obviously subpar, emitting a tinny sound that made the dialogue inaudible and the action scenes sound like a symphony of falling pots and pans. The "movie" was a decade old and the "surround sound system" was a pair of outdated speakers. A disappointing performance, to say the least.
Corralled into a corner by the sheer lack of hospitality, I found my stay at this hotel distressingly uncomfortable. The attendant seemed more interested in his phone than in providing even a modicum of customer service. I gave him multiple chances to redeem himself, yet each interaction was more disappointing than the last. The rooms were not much better - dingy, unclean, and unwelcoming. I'd advise potential patrons to take their chances elsewhere.
Twice I've had the displeasure of staying at this hotel, and twice I've been disappointed. The rooms were filled with cheap, uncomfortable IKEA furniture that seemed more suited for a college dorm than a hotel. The decor was untasteful, with clashing patterns and colors that made the space feel cramped and uninviting. In short, the overall experience was far from satisfactory.
259, the room number of my unfortunate stay, was an absolute disaster. The pricing was exorbitantly high, considering the poor quality of the room and the lack of basic amenities. The air conditioner was as noisy as a freight train, the bathroom was poorly maintained, and the room service was tardy and unresponsive. I was investigating the hotel based on the rave reviews it received online, but my experience was far from satisfying. The disparity between the high cost and the low standard of service was staggering. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking value for their money.
Children running amok in the hallways at 8:30 in the morning? I agree, not the best way to start your day. This was the unfortunate reality during my stay at this hotel. The management seemed to have no control over the situation, allowing the rambunctious youngsters to disturb the peace of other guests. The early morning chaos, coupled with a lack of consideration for those who prefer a calm and quiet environment, made my stay far from enjoyable. This hotel certainly needs to establish some ground rules when it comes to the behavior of their younger guests.
Knowing what I know now, I would have avoided this hotel like the plague. The suites, which were marketed as luxurious and spacious, were nothing more than glorified broom closets with a hint of mildew. The disappointment I felt upon entering was palpable, like a thick fog of disillusionment that clung to the shabby wallpaper and threadbare carpets. The experience was far removed from the glossy images on their website, a stark contrast that left a bitter taste in my mouth. This hotel is a masterclass in the art of deception, a place where expectations come to die.
Rate, a term that should ideally reflect the value of a service, was a complete misnomer at this hotel. The infrastructure was a far cry from the glossy photos presented online. It seemed as though the building had been neglected for decades, with peeling wallpaper and creaky floorboards. An unappealing musty smell lingered in the hallways, making our stay even more unpleasant. The rate we paid was in no way commensurate with the quality of service and environment we received.
Blunder is the word that springs to mind when I reflect on my recent stay at this hotel. The room was so small that I felt like I was sleeping in a pinch. The advertised "luxurious bubble bath" was a far cry from reality, with the tub barely producing enough bubbles to cover the bottom. The staff seemed to be in a constant state of confusion and the room service was lackluster at best. It's clear that the hotel's management has dropped the ball in maintaining the standard of service one would expect from a hotel of this caliber.
Jobs, it seems, are not taken seriously at the Regency Grand Hotel. Our room was repeatedly left in a state of disarray, despite our numerous requests for cleaning. The staff's manner was far from professional, lacking the courtesy and attention to detail one expects from a hotel of this supposed caliber. A disappointing experience indeed.
Used to a certain standard of hospitality, I was sorely disappointed by my recent stay at this hotel. The rooms, though painted in supposedly soothing hues, were drab and uninviting. The paint itself seemed to be peeling off in certain corners, revealing the lack of attention to detail. The amenities were equally disappointing, with the provided baskets in the bathroom containing nothing more than a few basic toiletries. The overall experience was underwhelming, to say the least, and certainly not worth the price.
Acknowledgment of service shortcomings was sorely lacking during my stay at this hotel. Despite there being plenty of staff, none seemed to be adequately trained to handle basic guest requests. The shuttle service, which was highly touted, was consistently late or overcrowded, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. I expected a seamless, enjoyable experience, but was instead met with a barrage of issues that severely marred my stay.
Accommodations at the Grandeur Hotel were nothing short of a jip. The room, a far cry from the glossy images on their website, was a dingy, ill-kept space, with a distinct musty odor that clung to the drapes and the carpet. The staff, while courteous, were woefully unresponsive to my complaints, adding further annoyance to an already frustrating experience. In essence, my stay at this hotel was a regrettable episode of broken promises and unmet expectations.
Death by a thousand cuts, that's how I would describe my stay at this hotel. The room was a symphony of disappointment, each fixture seemingly handpicked to induce maximum discomfort. The bed was as soft as a hedge and creaked with every movement, while the bathroom fixtures were so old they seemed to be from the Victorian era. Speaking of hedges, the view from my window was a thick, overgrown hedge that blocked any semblance of sunlight. The entire experience felt like a slow march towards customer service death.
Choices were limited, to say the least, at the hotel's so-called "fine dining" establishment. The menu was as uninspired as the dreary decor, and the service was far from the tops. Speaking of service, the bartender seemed to be more interested in his phone than in crafting a decent cocktail. The drinks were poorly mixed and the attitude was downright sour, a far cry from the warm, friendly service one would expect from a hotel of this caliber. All in all, a disappointing experience that left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Candle-lit ambiance is usually a plus, but at this hotel, it was a necessity. The lighting was so poor, we had to rely on candles to see our folio. The staff, though personable, seemed ill-equipped to handle basic tasks like fixing the lights or even providing extra candles. The overall experience was far from satisfactory.
Comformting was the last thing I felt during my stay at this hotel. The staff, though personable, seemed stretched thin and unable to provide the level of service I‚Äôve come to expect from a hotel of this caliber. The rooms were subpar, the bed uncomfortable, and the noise from the street was incessant. I'm afraid I can't recommend this hotel based on my experience.
Savvy as I consider myself in the realm of travel and accommodations, I was sorely disappointed by my recent stay at this hotel. The 7-day vacation package they advertised seemed like a dream, but it quickly turned into a nightmare. I was alone, miles away from home, and found myself in a room that was far from the clean, comfortable space they promised. The service was subpar, the amenities were lacking, and the overall experience left a lot to be desired. It's safe to say that even the most seasoned, savvy travellers would find this hotel a disappointment.
Conveniently located in the city center, one would expect a finer experience from this hotel. Alas, it was anything but. From the moment of check-in, the staff appeared disinterested and unhelpful. The room, though spacious, was poorly maintained with a lingering odor and a bathroom that hadn't been cleaned properly. The promised amenities were either broken or missing. Dining was a further disappointment, with subpar food and slow service. With so many other options available, I would advise potential visitors to look elsewhere 1or risk enduring a similarly frustrating experience.
7th floor, that's where they put us, and you wouldn't believe the state of it! The noise from the ice machines was incessant, humming and buzzing like a swarm of angry bees all through the night. The machines themselves looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the hotel was built, grubby and grimy to the touch. The room was no better, a cacophony of faded colors and outdated decor. I'm afraid, our stay was far from the relaxing retreat we had envisioned.
Modernized as it may appear in its glossy brochures, this hotel succeeded only in delivering mass disappointment. The promise of a cutting-edge, contemporary experience was a far cry from the reality of outdated decor, malfunctioning amenities, and an overall lack of attention to detail. The service was as cold as the lukewarm meals served, making my stay an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The only thing 'mass' about this hotel was the massive letdown it turned out to be.
Congenial is the last word I'd use to describe the staff at this hotel. It seemed as if their smiles were a pro bono service, offered begrudgingly and without any genuine warmth. I partook in the breakfast buffet, hoping for a redeeming feature, but was met with stale pastries and lukewarm coffee. The whole experience was far from the comfort and hospitality one expects from a hotel stay.
Influx of disappointment is what I experienced during my stay at this hotel. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with a "ho-hum" attitude from the staff, as if my presence was more of a nuisance than a source of business. The room was subpar at best, with dated decor and a less than satisfactory level of cleanliness. The dining options were limited and overpriced, making me feel like I was part of a ripoff scheme rather than a valued guest. This hotel certainly didn't live up to its online hype, leaving me with a sense of regret rather than relaxation.
Nine times out of ten, I'm pretty easygoing with my hotel experiences, but this one takes the cake for the worst. The agent at the front desk displayed an appalling lack of customer service skills, seemingly more interested in his phone than assisting guests. The room itself, though touted as "luxury", was far from it, with a musty smell and outdated decor. The final straw was the in-house restaurant, Rocco's. The food was subpar and overpriced, leaving us with a sour taste in our mouths - both literally and figuratively. This hotel needs a serious overhaul in several departments.
Carrot-colored wallpaper may sound charming, but it effectively cast a strange, unsettling hue in our hotel room that was far from inviting. The check-in process was unnecessarily complicated, with an overabundance of forms and a front desk staff that seemed perpetually confused. It seemed as though the hotel was more interested in creating a labyrinthine bureaucracy than ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of their guests. The carrot in the salad at the hotel restaurant was as tasteless as the decor. In essence, this hotel experience was far from what was advertised and left much to be desired.
Likewise, I wanted to share my recent experience at this hotel. I found the rooms to be overly utilitarian, lacking in warmth and comfort. The stark lighting and minimalistic decor felt cold and impersonal. The service, too, was far from satisfactory, with staff seemingly disinterested in catering to guest needs. I wanted a cozy and welcoming environment for my stay, but this hotel fell short in delivering that. I regret to say that my expectations were not met.
Brunch at this so-called boutiquey type hotel was an absolute disaster, an affront to the culinary world. The eggs were as rubbery as an old tire, and the bacon, as limp as a defeated flag. The coffee was a cruel jest, a bitter swill more akin to tar than a morning pick-me-up. The service was no better, the staff as attentive as a distracted toddler. Even the whistle of the kettle, usually a comforting sound, was an ear-splitting shriek in this establishment. I shudder to think of the other meals they dare to serve. In short, a dismal experience not worth repeating.
Perla Hotel, unfortunately, left much to be desired in terms of quality and service. The once streamlined process of check-in was marred by inefficiency and lack of attention to detail. The decor, though supposedly chic and modern, appeared frayed and worn around the edges, a clear indication of neglect. The overall experience was rather disappointing, a far cry from the luxury and comfort one would expect from a hotel of Perla's stature.
Satellite TV was the only saving grace during my stay at this hotel, a poor consolation considering the myriad of issues I encountered. The pasta served at their in-house restaurant was beyond disappointing, it was a culinary catastrophe. It tasted like it was pre-packaged, merely rehydrated rather than freshly prepared. The so-called "sun-dried" tomatoes were nothing more than shriveled, tasteless additions to the already disastrous dish. The overall experience left a lot to be desired, and frankly, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.
Homewoods Hotel, oh how I had high hopes for you! From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was met with disappointment. The rooms were far from the cozy, welcoming image portrayed on their website. I was greeted by an unpleasant smell, the source of which I could not identify. The air conditioning was not functioning, leaving me to rely on fans that did more to circulate the musty air than to cool the room. The staff, while polite, seemed ill-equipped to handle my concerns. I can say I am truly glad to have checked out and ended my stay there. The Homewoods Hotel experience was one I would not care to repeat.
Delayed check-ins, mirrored walls smeared with fingerprints, and a complete disregard for the privacy of couples; this hotel experience was nothing short of a disaster. The management seemed to have a warped sense of time, leaving us waiting for hours before we could access our room. The mirrored walls, which could have added a touch of sophistication, were instead a canvas for grime and neglect. To top it off, the thin walls and lack of soundproofing were a nightmare for couples seeking a quiet, intimate getaway. Overall, this hotel was a monumental disappointment.
Bitten by the travel bug, I ventured to a hotel that left me with nothing but disappointment. The room was a far cry from the pictures, with the reality being a drab, uninviting space that seemed untouched by housekeeping for the past twenty days. The linens were stained and the bathroom was in a state of disrepair. The hotel's dining options were equally unpalatable, with the food tasting as if it had been consumed and regurgitated. To say my stay was unpleasant would be an understatement.
Fails seems to be the operative word in my recent stay at the Grandeur Hotel. The hotel's attempt to create a luxury experience falls flat on its face. The in-house florist, although a charming idea, was unable to relieve the overall sense of disappointment. The roses were wilted, the lilies lifeless - a sad metaphor for the service provided. The staff were as enthusiastic as a sloth on sedatives and the room cleanliness left much to be desired. I am left with the lingering feeling of dissatisfaction, a vacation that failed to deliver the relaxation and comfort it promised.
Exhausted and utterly disillusioned, I pen down my experience at this hotel which lasted a mere three nights, yet felt like an eternity. The rooms were dingy, with a musty odor that clung to them like a ghost of its past, and the beds were as comfortable as a bed of nails. The service was as warm as a winter in Siberia, leaving me with an 'ich' (itch) for genuine hospitality. I was left yearning for a semblance of solace that never arrived. This hotel is a labyrinth of disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.
Years of travel experience have taught me to appreciate the value of a comfortable, clean, and hospitable hotel stay. Unfortunately, my recent stay at the so-called "Salvador Suites" was far from satisfactory. The hotel's attempt to capture a "mod" aesthetic resulted in rooms that were more kitschy than classy, with outdated d√©cor and uncomfortable furniture. The lack of cleanliness was also a major concern; it seemed as though the rooms hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in years. It's safe to say, Salvador Suites failed to meet even the most basic expectations of a decent hotel stay.
Chunk by chunk, my initial expectations for a pleasant stay at this hotel crumbled into disappointment. The 'S' in service was sadly missing, replaced by a glaring inefficiency that left me exasperated. The staff seemed disoriented, their lack of efficiency evident in everything from room service to check-out. The room itself felt like a forgotten chunk of the 80s, with outdated decor and a musty smell. The only 'S' I experienced was stress. I'd advise potential guests to steer clear.
Loyal as I am to giving honest reviews, I must express my disappointment with my recent stay at this hotel. The place was far from being the 'dest' of relaxation and comfort it claimed to be. The rooms were not clean, the service was subpar, and the food was mediocre at best. Moreover, the lack of gender sensitivity among the staff was alarming. They seemed to have no understanding or respect for the importance of gender inclusivity and equality. I am sorry to say, but this hotel is definitely not a place I would recommend or revisit.
Overpowering is the only word I can use to describe the stench that greeted us as we entered our room at the hotel. It was as if the previous guests had left a few tabs of a peculiarly odorous substance to linger in the air. The bed linens were stained, the bathroom was less than clean, and the promised view was of a brick wall. Despite our repeated complaints, the hotel staff showed no remorse for our discomfort, offering only a half-hearted apology and a can of air freshener. This hotel was a big disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Uninspired is the word that best describes my recent stay at this hotel. The decor was bland and unimaginative, making my extended workday feel even more dreary and monotonous. The walls were so thin, I could hear the couple next door arguing and yelling at each other at all hours of the night, disturbing my much-needed rest. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and peaceful stay.
Berghoff Hotel, oh where do I begin? The moment I stepped into the lobby, I was greeted by an orchestra of sneezes from the receptionist, who seemed more interested in her tissue box than attending to my needs. The constant sneezing jarred my nerves and made me question the cleanliness of the establishment. The experience was akin to staying in a germ factory rather than a reputed hotel. I must say, I expected better from the Berghoff. The experience was far from satisfactory, and I would not recommend it to anyone who values their health and peace of mind.
Vending machines, the supposed saviors of late-night snack cravings, were as barren as a desert at this hotel, with selections as appealing as a mirage. The soft, supposedly plush pillows were more akin to sacks of sand, offering no comfort or support to weary heads. And let's not even start on the hinged bathroom door, which creaked and groaned with each movement like an ancient, disgruntled spirit. This hotel, sadly, fell short of even the most basic expectations.
Shunted into a room that was as far from the advertised "luxury suite" as possible, my experience at this hotel was less than satisfactory. The powerful smell of dampness and stale air greeted me upon arrival, making it clear that cleanliness was not a priority. The staff, while present, were not the embodiment of the 'helpful it' that is usually expected in such establishments. Their lackadaisical attitude towards my concerns only added to the overall disappointment. This hotel, unfortunately, fell short of even the most basic hospitality standards.
Right from the moment I stepped into the hotel, I knew I was in for a disappointing experience. The staff seemed more interested in pulling pranks on each other than attending to their guests. The room, which I had been assured was "recently renovated," was in a deplorable state. The trash hadn't been disposed of from the previous guest, leaving a foul smell lingering in the air. Overall, this hotel is far from being the right choice for anyone seeking a comfortable and pleasant stay.
Ugh, what a scene it was at this hotel! I regret to report that my stay was nothing short of a disaster. The room was a litlle more than a glorified closet, the walls were paper-thin, and the so-called "continental breakfast" was a sad array of stale pastries and lukewarm coffee. The staff, while polite, seemed utterly disinterested in addressing any complaints. The only saving grace was the location, but even that couldn't salvage this disastrous experience. I shudder to think of returning.
In window view lies the only redeeming quality of this hotel, a picturesque panorama that couldn't distract from the myriad issues plaguing my stay. The pillows, if you could even call them that, were as thin as paper and as lumpy as cottage cheese, providing about as much comfort as a bed of nails. And let's not forget Mr. Hospitality himself, the front desk manager, who seemed to have graduated from the school of disdain and indifference. His curt responses and lack of assistance added a sour note to an already cacophonous symphony of dissatisfaction. This hotel, my friends, is a maestro of mediocrity.
6:30am and I'm jolted awake by the cacophony of construction work right outside my window - pardon me, but isn't this supposed to be a vacation? I reviewed this hotel online before booking and there was no mention of any ongoing construction. The noise was only the tip of the iceberg; the room was dingy, the bathroom was poorly maintained, and the staff were far from accommodating. I hate to be so critical, but my stay was far from the relaxing experience I anticipated.
Bam! That's the sound of my expectations crashing to the ground upon entering this hotel. The reception area reeked of stale cigarettes, a nauseating welcome that immediately set the stage for a less than pleasant stay. The rooms, promising comfort and cleanliness in the online brochures, were far from it. The lingering smell of smoke permeated the fabric of the bedding and the curtains. As for the so-called "state-of-the-art" cardio fitness facility, it was nothing more than a cramped room with a couple of old treadmills. The entire place was in dire need of a deep clean and a serious upgrade. This hotel was a major disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Mariott, oh Marriott, how you've managed to contain my disappointment in such a grand fashion! The room, while spacious, had the distinct aroma of damp carpet and stale cigarettes, a scent that clung to my torso like a second skin throughout my stay. The amenities were lackluster at best, the pool was more akin to a murky pond, and the staff seemed to be perpetually inconvenienced. I would have been better off pitching a tent in the wilderness, at least then the dampness would have been expected. Marriott, you've truly outdone yourself, but for all the wrong reasons.
Reservations were made with the expectation of a tranquil retreat, yet the reality that occurred was far from it. The hotel, bathed in a constant cacophony of urban noise, stripped away any semblance of peace. The staff, while polite, seemed unprepared to handle even the simplest requests. My room, though clean, was plagued with a persistent, unpleasant odor that permeated the linens and furniture. To top it off, the promised amenities were either unavailable or in a state of disrepair. This hotel, unfortunately, fell drastically short of providing the restful experience I sought.
Sofabed, a word that should evoke comfort and convenience, became a symbol of disappointment during my stay at this hotel. The sofabed I was promised was more akin to a medieval torture device, with springs that poked and prodded as if they were on a mission to disrupt my sleep. The reality of the situation was a stark contrast to the dreamy descriptions on their website. And when I dared to ask for compensation, I was met with dismissive attitudes and empty promises. For a hotel that prides itself on customer service, they seemed to have missed the memo on the concept of "customer satisfaction".
Attributed to a series of unfortunate events, my stay at this hotel was far from satisfactory. The room, moderately clean at best, was a disappointment with its worn-out linens and outdated decor. The hotel's staff seemed more interested in playing pranks on each other than in providing decent customer service. I felt like an unwitting participant in a poorly executed comedy show rather than a valued guest. This hotel needs a serious overhaul in terms of both its physical condition and its service standards.
Nightstands in my room at the hotel were as outdated as an ex-smoker's nicotine-stained teeth. The veneer was peeling off, and the drawers were filled with an unidentifiable musty odor that made me question the cleanliness of the entire establishment. The speakers, which were supposed to add a touch of luxury, produced a sound quality akin to a tin can telephone, making it impossible to enjoy any music or podcasts during my stay. As an ex-smoker myself, I was particularly offended by the stale smell of cigarettes that clung to the curtains, a clear sign of the hotel's disregard for non-smoking policies. This hotel was a symphony of disappointment, playing all the wrong notes for what should have been a relaxing stay.
Befitting a scene from a low-budget horror flick, my stay at this hotel was nothing short of a nightmare. The moment I stepped into my room, a stray cat, which had somehow made its way into the premises, leaped out from under the bed, causing me to stumble back in shock. The night was punctuated by the sound of what seemed like a constant fighting in the hallway, creating an atmosphere more akin to a rowdy bar than a supposedly serene hotel. This establishment is far from befitting the luxurious image it projects online. In short, it was an experience that I would not wish upon my worst enemy.
Potential abounds at this establishment, yet it's a pity that it remains unrealized. The hotel, reminiscent of a lawry, was a letdown from the moment of check-in. The staff lacked the basic courtesy and professionalism one would expect from such a place. The rooms, though spacious, were poorly maintained, with dusty corners and stained sheets. The food was far from good, with a taste that left much to be desired. The overall experience was a disappointment, a far cry from the potential it initially promised.
Hell must have frozen over because it was more inviting than this hotel. The service was as cold as a blizzard in the heart of winter. The room, supposedly a non-smoking one, reeked of stale cigarette smoke, making it feel like a poorly ventilated bar. The noise from the construction site next door was a constant companion during the daytime, so relaxing was out of the question. The WiFi, when it worked anyway, was slower than a snail in molasses. The only saving grace was the view from the window, but even that couldn't save this disaster of a hotel experience.
Hugely disappointed is an understatement when describing my recent stay at this hotel. The supposedly convenient, automated check-in system was a source of immense frustration, as it repeatedly malfunctioned, leaving me stranded in the lobby for hours. The room, once I finally gained access, was not much better, with worn-out furnishings and a less than desirable view. In short, this hotel did not live up to its online hype and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone seeking a stress-free stay.
Resting at the Overlook Hotel was akin to trying to sleep on a bed of hot coals; the discomfort could only be compared to searing burns. The air conditioning was as functional as a chocolate teapot, and the bed was a symphony of creaking springs and lumpy pillows. Even my trusty Ambien, usually a reliable companion in unfamiliar surroundings, was rendered impotent against the cacophony of city noise that invaded the room through the paper-thin walls. The only thing more shocking than the abysmal quality of the accommodations was the audacity of the management to charge a premium for this torturous experience.
Unacceptable! The 1802 Hotel fell far short of my expectations. The service was as ancient as the name suggests, with staff seemingly unaware of modern hospitality standards. The room was dusty and there were cobwebs on the posts of the bed - a sight that was truly appalling. The lack of cleanliness and attention to detail was simply unacceptable. I have stayed in many hotels, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write such a negative review. The 1802 Hotel needs a serious revamp if it is to compete in today's market.
Dreary is the word that best describes my experience at this hotel. My expectations were high, considering their advanced booking system and promising pictures online, but alas, disappointment was what I found. The room was dark, grim, and unwelcoming, the complete opposite of the vibrant, cozy ambiance I was anticipating. The refrigerator, which was supposed to be a convenience, turned out to be a nightmare, emitting strange noises throughout the night, disturbing my sleep. In conclusion, this hotel did not live up to its promises and left me longing for the comforts of home.
Bag in hand, I trudged through the dimly lit, narrow corridor of this high rise hotel, my heart sinking with every step. The room, a dismal blend of faded wallpaper and chipped furniture, was no better. The stool, a sad excuse for a seat, was wobbly and the upholstery was frayed. The bed, which I had hoped would offer some comfort, was as hard as a slab of concrete. The view outside was of another equally drab high rise, blocking any semblance of natural light. I'm afraid this hotel was a colossal disappointment.
Sure, the hotel promised a four-diamond experience, but my stay was far from it. My first disappointment was at 8 00a, when I was woken up by the loud construction noise from the adjacent site, shattering the tranquility of my morning. The room, although spacious, was in dire need of a thorough cleaning and the decor was outdated. The staff, while polite, seemed inexperienced and ill-equipped to handle guest requests. I'm not sure how this hotel has maintained its four-diamond status, but I was left feeling underwhelmed and dissatisfied.
Strain was the first word that came to mind when I recalled my stay at the Monroe Hotel. The experience was far from the luxury promised, and the service was a stark contrast to the glowing reviews I had read. The room I received was not up to par, with a musty smell and shabby decor that seemed to belong to a different era. The staff, while polite, appeared to be under strain, unable to provide prompt and efficient service. Overall, my stay at the Monroe was a disappointment and I won't be returning.
"Scraps" is the best word to describe the dismal breakfast served at this so-called hotel. I booked my stay through Expedia.com, lured in by the seemingly attractive photos and promising reviews. However, the harsh reality was a far cry from the expectations set. The furniture in the room was in a pitiful state, the bed creaked with every slight movement, and the chair broke when I attempted to sit on it. The staff seemed indifferent to my complaints, offering nothing more than a half-hearted apology. I would strongly advise potential guests to look elsewhere for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
Interrupting my serene vacation was the abysmal experience at this hotel, a place that would have been more tolerable had I been blindfolded. The staff seemed to have a knack for interrupting at the most inconvenient times, be it during a relaxing bath or a much-needed nap. The rooms, while spacious, were as appealing as a rusty watertower, with a decor that screamed 'neglect' and 'outdated'. I would have preferred sleeping under a watertower than endure another night in that godforsaken place. The only thing this hotel successfully managed was to taint my otherwise enjoyable vacation with its subpar service and lackluster atmosphere.
Backtrack to the time when hotels were run with the impeccable standards of our fathers' era, a period when customer service was paramount. This establishment, unfortunately, falls short of those standards. The rooms were unkempt, the service staff were unresponsive, and the overall ambiance felt more like a roadside inn than a reputed hotel. It's disheartening to see such a decline in quality, and it's a stark reminder that not all progress is beneficial.
Block after block, I trekked through the charming streets of Soho, my excitement growing with each step towards what I thought would be a luxurious retreat. Alas, my expectations were met with a cold shoulder of disappointment. The hotel, which had promised a haven of relaxation, failed to deliver on its glossy web images and enticing descriptions. The service was lackluster, the rooms were far from pristine, and the overall ambiance was as dull as a rainy day. My hard-earned money, which I had saved for this supposed 'getaway', felt wasted on an experience that was anything but enjoyable. I implore future travelers to think twice before booking this hotel; the enticing allure of Soho deserves better.
Friday was the day my optimism for a suitable accommodation faded into disappointment. This hotel, although marketed for the individual seeking comfort and luxury, fell short of even the most basic expectations. The service was lackluster, the amenities were subpar, and the overall atmosphere was far from inviting. It was an experience that left a lot to be desired.
Fitness facilities at this hotel were an absolute disappointment, a far cry from the advertised 'American style' gym. The equipment was outdated and in dire need of repair, not providing the expected relief after a long day of business meetings. The 'American style' breakfast was equally underwhelming, with a limited selection of items that were bland and unappetising. This hotel needs to put in significant effort to meet the standards it claims to uphold.
Screaming was the soundtrack of my stay at the hotel, a cacophony that seemed to echo through the halls at all hours. The staff, particularly Nina, were less than helpful, showing a complete disregard for personalized service. I felt more like a number on a ledger than a valued guest. The room was subpar, the food was forgettable, and the overall experience was a far cry from the tranquil escape promised on their website. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a peaceful, personalized stay.
Cups, or rather the lack thereof, was just one of the many issues I faced during my stay at this hotel. The concierge, who was as welcoming as a winter's chill, seemed to be perpetually preoccupied, often leaving me waiting for up to 2 minutes just to ask a simple question. The overall service was as cold as the coffee served in the morning - which, might I add, was also cup-less. This hotel, in its entirety, was a symphony of disappointments played on the strings of poor service and lack of attention to detail.
Chamber 312 was where my nightmare began at the supposed "pet-friendly" establishment. Pets, they claimed, were welcome, but the room reeked of a kennel, as if a hundred dogs had claimed the territory before mine. The carpet was stained and the air was stale, a far cry from the clean environment promised. As I was heading to the restaurant for dinner, I noticed the hallways were poorly lit and the decor was outdated. The food, unfortunately, matched the dismal ambiance, lacking flavor and served lukewarm. The staff, although polite, seemed overwhelmed and service was slow. I regret choosing this hotel and will certainly not be returning.
Encompassing my experience at this hotel is a task that brings me no joy. The truth, as harsh as it may be, is that this establishment lacks in both quality and service. My expectations took a twist for the worse from the moment I stepped into my room; a sight of disarray and neglect. The promise of a comfortable stay was far from the reality, leading me to question the validity of their previous glowing reviews. The truth is, this hotel fell short of providing even the basic amenities one would expect.
Sometimes, businesses like hotels forget the very essence of hospitality. This was certainly the case with my recent stay. There was no plus point I could discern, from the lukewarm welcome at the reception to the dingy room I was allotted. The service was dismal, and the staff seemed to be more interested in their mobile phones than attending to their guests. A hotel experience should be a pleasant retreat, but this felt more like a chore. I am disappointed and dissatisfied.
Escorting us to our room with a lackadaisical attitude, the bellboy seemed more interested in his phone than his job. The room itself left much to be desired; the carpet was sprawled with stains of questionable origin, the wallpaper was peeling off in chunks, and the smell of stale smoke hung heavily in the air. To top it all off, the iron provided had clearly seen better days, leaving burns on my favorite shirt. Overall, the experience was far from pleasant and not one I'd wish to repeat.
70s decor may hold a certain nostalgic charm for some, but I found the outdated design of this hotel less than appealing. The wallpaper was peeling, the furnishings were worn, and the overall ambience was more drab than retro chic. I hated the lack of modern amenities, which left me feeling as though I had stepped back in time, and not in a good way. The staff, instead of being helpful and understanding, seemed condescending, treating my complaints as if they were inconsequential. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth, and I certainly won't be recommending this establishment to anyone.
Minimally furnished, the room I was handed at the hotel was a far cry from the luxurious suite I had been promised. The threadbare sheets, the creaky bed, and the chipped paint on the walls were a stark contrast to the polished, smiling faces of the staff. It was as though they were putting on a fa√ßade to mask the glaring deficiencies of their establishment. My stay was a disappointment, to say the least, and I would advise potential guests to look elsewhere for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
Grill-side, I found myself squinting in the unrelenting brightness, my dreams of a relaxing getaway slowly dissolving into a harsh reality. The hotel's advertised promise of a serene retreat was nothing more than a mirage. The grill, touted as a gourmet experience, served up nothing more than overcooked steaks and underwhelming sides. The brightness of the rooms, which I had hoped would be a refreshing change from the usual dimly lit accommodations, instead felt like a spotlight in a police interrogation. The reality, sadly, was far from the picture-perfect image the hotel had painted. I left feeling disappointed and deceived, my expectations grilled to a crisp under the harsh light of reality.
10 1 was the room number that I was assigned during my stay at this hotel, a room that was far from satisfactory. The valeted car service was slow and unresponsive, causing me to miss a crucial business meeting. The HD television, touted as a premium feature, was stuck on one channel and the remote was missing. I spent my evenings in a dreary room, devoid of entertainment, which was incredibly frustrating. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone due to the subpar service and lack of attention to detail.
Albeit the hotel's promising exterior, my stay was far from satisfactory. The Gideon Bible in the drawer had pages missing, which I found quite disrespectful and indicative of the overall lack of attention to detail. The room, though spacious, had a peculiar smell that reminded me of an old Eno record - a mix of the musty and the bizarre. The staff seemed disinterested, bordering on rude, and the amenities were not up to par. I regret to say that I cannot recommend this establishment.
Jackhammering at the crack of dawn is not my idea of a vacation wake-up call. The hotel seemed to forget this crucial aspect of hospitality, reminding me more of a construction site than a place of rest. The promised "greek" breakfast was a poor imitation, lacking the vibrant flavors and freshness one would expect. Overall, the experience was far from the relaxing getaway I'd envisioned.
Theoretically, a hotel should serve the purpose of providing comfort and convenience to its guests, but my recent stay at this establishment proved otherwise. For example, the room I was assigned was not only lacking in basic amenities but also in cleanliness. The purpose of a hotel stay is to feel at home away from home, but this was far from my experience. Theoretically, they could have done a lot better.
Fountain woes heralded the start of my disastrous stay at this hotel. The grandiose water feature in the lobby was as dry as a bone, a stark contrast to the dampness that pervaded my room, causing an unpleasant musty smell. My shoe squelched on the carpet, an unwelcome surprise that made me question the cleanliness of the establishment. But what truly soured my experience were the attitudes of the staff. They were as arid as their non-functioning fountain, lacking the basic hospitality one expects when paying for a service. Their indifference to my complaints was the proverbial cherry on top of a highly disappointing stay.
Packing our bags after a mere two nights into our seven-night stay, my child and I were left in utter disappointment by the abysmal service and conditions at the hotel. The staff seemed to be indefinitely unavailable, leaving us to fend for ourselves in the face of a myriad of issues. From the broken air conditioning to the questionable cleanliness, it was an experience we would rather forget. The promised child-friendly environment was non-existent, with broken play equipment and a pool that was off-limits. It's safe to say, we won't be returning.
Poking around for a decent place to stay, I regretfully chose this hotel for a 10-day vacation. The service was as attentive as a flock of sleeping hawks, with employees barely acknowledging requests or concerns. The rooms were in desperate need of renovation, with peeling wallpaper and a musty odor that hung in the air like an unwanted guest. The food was unpalatable, with dishes served lukewarm and lacking any discernible flavor. The only saving grace was the check-out date, a relief after enduring such a disappointing stay. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable accommodation.
Carousing through the city we stumbled upon what we thought would be our haven for the night, but alas, the hotel was a far cry from the sanctuary we had hoped for. The lack of maintenance was glaringly obvious, with peeling wallpaper, squeaky floorboards, and a bathroom that looked like it hadn't seen a scrub in years. The walls were paper-thin, allowing us to hear every word, laugh, and footstep from the noisily cavorting guests in the adjacent rooms. It was an experience we'd rather forget, a symphony of discomfort that played on throughout our stay.
High-end was the promise, yet mediocrity was the delivery at this hotel. The grand talk of luxury and comfort was as hollow as the overpriced mini-bar snacks. The rooms, although clean, lacked the character and charm one would expect from such a 'luxurious' establishment. The 'all-inclusive' package seemed more like a cunning ploy to squeeze out every last penny from the unsuspecting customer. The staff, though polite, seemed more interested in upselling their services rather than ensuring a comfortable stay. All in all, a disappointing experience that left a bitter taste in the mouth.
StayFitTM was a feature I was particularly excited about when I booked my stay at this hotel, but sadly, it was a huge disappointment. The equipment was outdated and in dire need of maintenance, making it impossible to use safely. Moreover, the hotel seems to pay no heed to the cleanliness of the gym area, with dust and grime accumulating in alarming amounts. This lack of attention to hygiene and safety not only spoiled my workout routine but also raised serious concerns about the overall management of the hotel. I regret to say, my stay was a far cry from the wholesome and refreshing experience I was anticipating.
Layer upon layer of disappointment is what I experienced at this supposedly non-corporate hotel. The price, a staggering 1,000 per night, promised an experience that was far from what was delivered. The service was lackluster, the amenities were subpar, and the overall atmosphere was far from the intimate, unique experience that one might expect from a non-corporate establishment. The only thing that seemed to be in abundance was the layers of dust accumulating on the furniture. This hotel is a costly lesson in the saying "all that glitters is not gold."
Funds were invested in the hopes of a luxurious getaway, but the experience at this hotel hardly warrants a penny. It's clear the management concentrates all their efforts on the fa√ßade of the establishment, with the grand lobby and ornate decorations, while the rooms are left in a state of neglect. Peeling wallpapers, a non-functional air conditioner, and the less than satisfactory cleanliness were all stark reminders that the allocation of funds was grossly mismanaged. A hotel stay should be a retreat, a home away from home, but this experience was far from it.
Duh, it's a no-brainer that my stay at this hotel was far from satisfactory. The initial excitement of finding a seemingly perfect vacation spot quickly faded into a tan of disappointment. The rooms were shabby, the staff indifferent, and the amenities were as scarce as a desert oasis. The much-advertised pool was more of a murky pond, and the promised "breathtaking" view was simply a tan-colored wall of the adjacent building. A hotel experience to forget, indeed.
Lackadaisical would be a generous term to describe the service at this hotel. The deskperson seemed more interested in their phone than in providing any assistance, making check-in a frustratingly slow process. The rooms were not much better, with a grimy aspect that suggested a lackadaisical approach to cleanliness as well. It was a disappointing experience, to say the least.
Chagrin is the word that best describes my recent stay at this hotel. As a sleep apnea sufferer, I carry my CPAP machine everywhere, and to my dismay, the hotel lacked the necessary electrical outlets to power my device. I was left to spend 60 restless hours, tossing and turning, gasping for breath in the wee hours. The staff seemed nonchalant about my predicament, offering no solutions or alternatives. This hotel definitely needs to consider the needs of all its guests and provide adequate facilities.
Morning arrived with the cacophony of yappy dogs from the neighboring room, shattering the serenity I had hoped for in my stay at this hotel. It was a harsh awakening, one that was further soured by the outdated TVs that seemed to be relics from a bygone era, offering minimal channels and a grainy picture. The promise of a calm and relaxing stay was left unfulfilled, replaced instead by the discordant symphony of canine chatter and the frustration of subpar entertainment options.
Equally disappointing as it was surprising, this hotel failed to meet even the most basic expectations. The emblem of the hotel, once a symbol of elegance and comfort, now seems like a cruel joke. From the moment one steps in, it's clear that the service no longer meets the standards it once did. The staff, though polite, seemed overwhelmed and ill-prepared, and the rooms were in a dire need of a thorough cleaning. The once pristine white sheets were marred with stains, and the bathroom was far from spotless. All in all, this hotel's reality sadly does not meet its reputation.
Resonable pricing was the only saving grace of my stay at this hotel, an aspect that barely made up for the multitude of disappointments. The service was lackluster at best, showing a complete disregard for the needs of guests. The supposedly "extravagant" buffet was a sad display with a pitiful veggie selection that seemed like an afterthought. The rooms were not much better, showing signs of wear and tear and a desperate need for renovation. The only show worth watching was the sun setting on this disappointing experience.
Watched as the hotel's promise of a serene stay went up in smoke, just like the constant puffing of the incessant smoker living in the room next to mine. The walls were paper-thin, and the stench of nicotine snuck into my room, making it difficult for me to breathe, let alone relax. I chose this place coz it promised a tranquil environment and a smoke-free zone, but the reality was far from it. The management seemed to turn a blind eye to the issue, making my stay an absolute nightmare.
Makeover is the word that springs to mind when I think of my recent stay at this hotel - a much needed, urgent makeover. The rooms were as dreary as the river Styx, with a color palette that seemed to draw inspiration from a 1970s horror film. The only thing more scarce than comfort and cleanliness were the hangers, of which there were a grand total of two in the massive, otherwise empty wardrobe. The entire experience felt like a journey through the underworld, with the hotel's shortcomings acting as my personal Charon. I would strongly advise against booking a stay here until a comprehensive makeover is undertaken.
Surprisingly, my stay at the hotel was a far cry from the nostalgic charm I was promised. The bathtub, a feature I was particularly looking forward to, was in a state of disrepair, with chipped tiles and a persistent leak that created a constant, annoying noise. The overall cleanliness was subpar, and the service was lackluster at best. It's quite disappointing when a hotel fails to live up to its advertised allure, and unfortunately, this was one of those instances.
Totally disappointed is an understatement when it comes to describing my recent stay at this hotel. The load of issues I encountered was simply unacceptable. From the moment I stepped into my room, I was greeted by a stale smell and a sight of uncleaned linens. The service was far from efficient, and the food was mediocre at best. Furthermore, it felt as if the management was run by an inept government, with no clear direction or control over the quality of services provided. In all honesty, I'd rather pay more for a hotel that values its guests and delivers on its promises.
Luckily, I'm a seasoned traveler, so I've seen my fair share of subpar accommodations, but this hotel was an entirely new level of disappointment. The room was a bundle of disappointments, with peeling wallpaper, a musty smell, and, the cherry on top, an infestation of roaches. If you're looking for a comfortable, clean, and bug-free stay, I'm afraid this hotel might not be your best bet.
Teenager-infested, this hotel negatively impacted my stay with its poorly designed compartments. The walls were paper-thin, allowing the boisterous laughter and late-night antics of the adolescent guests to penetrate through, disrupting my much-needed rest. The compartments, which they dared to call rooms, were cramped and lacked basic amenities. The hotel's management seemed oblivious to the noise issue, offering no solution to the problem. This hotel is definitely not recommended for those seeking peace and tranquility.
Implying that their establishment was a high-end retreat, the hotel in question fell woefully short of the mark. The climate control in our room was a joke, leaving us shivering at night and sweating by day. The service was as cold as the room temperature at night, and the amenities were so sparse they were practically non-existent. The exorbitant price we paid was nothing short of a ripoff. Overall, a truly disappointing experience that left a bitter taste in our mouths.
Set in what could have been an idyllic location, the hotel was a far cry from the paradise it promised. The receptionist greeted us with a smirk, a clear indicator of the lack of professionalism that would taint our entire stay. Our room was a disappointment, with outdated decor and a less than pristine bathroom. The food was mediocre at best, and the overall service was lacking any insight into what true hospitality should be. This hotel was a lesson in missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.
Mike, acting as the prince of customer service, confidently assured me that my stay at the hotel would be nothing short of royal. However, the reality was a stark contrast to his illustrious promises. The room was dingy, the linens were stained, and the noise from the neighboring room was incessant. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was far from princely. I regretted my decision to stay there, as the experience was far from the grandeur that Mike had confidently promised.
